# Hate-Speech-Detector
This Hate Speech Detector is a natural language processing (NLP) project designed to identify hate speech in text. It utilizes a pre-trained model from Hugging Face, specifically the BERT-based model for sequence classification.

# Features
Text Classification: The model can classify input text into two categories: "Hate speech" and "Not hate speech."

Interactive Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to input text or upload CSV files for hate speech prediction.

CSV Batch Processing: Users can upload CSV files with text data, and the detector will provide predictions for each text entry.

# Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

Transformers Library (Hugging Face): Used to leverage the pre-trained BERT-based model for sequence classification.

PyTorch: The deep learning framework used by the pre-trained model.

# How to Use
Clone the repository: [git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hate-Speech-Detector.git](https://github.com/attaelahi/Hate-Speech-Detector.git)

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application: streamlit run app.py

Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501 and start making predictions.
